Ideas for Dataset
	1.	College dataset  
	Datasets are available that include information regarding type of university, student body size, rank, location, GPA, faculty size 
	Can make it more specific by looking at the university system in a specific state/country 
	2.	NYC leading cause of death: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/New-York-City-Leading-Causes-of-Death/jb7j-dtam 
	Datasets include number of deaths/year, leading causes of death, regions with most deaths  
	3.	Air Quality  
	Different measures of air quality based on cities, weather, population size  
	4.	Schools  
	Inspiration: https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/dress_codes (how dress codes in schools are sending sexualised messaging) 
	Potential data sets: National Centre for Education Statistics: https://nces.ed.gov/ 
	5.	Agriculture 
	Cornell has published datasets regarding different crops and wildlife  
	Can make it more specific by looking specifically at Cornell apple breeding data
